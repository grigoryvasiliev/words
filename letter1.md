Dear Madam/Sir,

I want to inform you that my family will arrive at Larnaka airport on Wednesday at 3 pm.
I would like to ask you to arrange the taxi for us at that time. 

I think it will take about one hour and a half to get to the hotel by cab. 
Therefore I and my family are going to have a dinner. If you help us with the arrangement of that, it would be very nice of you. 
On Thursday our plan is to visit the historical places in the downtown. Though before that we want to have a walk by the sea side. My expectation it is about two hours walk to get to the lighthouse and back to the hotel. I have heard there is a good sidewalk by the seaside.
