Introduction

I want to discuss the situation when  people are giving their money to other people for free. 
There are two main approaches to this in the modern society. One is called charitable donationsi to the well known organizations. 
Another one is when people know those to whome they give the money.

There is an opinion that if you donate to the organization then you do not know where your help goes. 
Also there are a lot of people working in the charitable structure which are paid from those donations. 
Thus it is possible that the inefficiency can creep into the process.  

At the same time when person works and has a familty, that person is busy with dayly routines and obligations. 
Kids must be properly educated. The partner must be loved and entertained.
Consequently there is no much room for thinking about others. 

From this perspective it is wiser to use the well established process that can deliver donations faster to people. 

But if there is a local community, it means the current situation is more visble even to busy people. 
In the local community people know each other and are very well acknoweldged who needs what and why.

Summary

Personally I prefer to know people I want to help to. 
Thouhg definitely it is the more main stream approach to donate to the national and charitable organizations.
It is simplier and faster.
